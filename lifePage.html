                <h1>Project Description: Conway's Game of Life on a 24x80 Pixel Grid in C</h1>
            <p>
                In this project, I recreated Conway's Game of Life, a classic cellular automaton, using the C programming language and implemented it on a 24 by 80 pixel grid. This hands-on project provided me with the opportunity to deepen my understanding of both fundamental programming concepts and advanced techniques.

            <h2>Key Skills and Concepts Learned:</h2>
            <ul class="left split">
                <li><strong>Algorithm Design and Implementation:</strong>
                    I designed and implemented the rules of Conway's Game of Life, involving understanding and applying the concepts of cellular automata. This required careful attention to the rules for cell survival and reproduction, and efficient implementation to ensure smooth execution on a constrained grid.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong>
                    Working in C, I managed memory allocation and deallocation for the 24x80 pixel grid, enhancing my skills in handling dynamic memory and pointers. This experience improved my ability to write efficient, memory-conscious code.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Grid-Based Data Structures:</strong>
                    I developed and utilized a 2D array to represent the grid, involving understanding and manipulating data structures effectively. This project honed my skills in working with multi-dimensional arrays and matrix operations.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Efficient Rendering:</strong>
                    I focused on optimizing the rendering of the grid to ensure updates were performed efficiently within the constraints of the 24x80 pixel display. This experience taught me about optimizing performance and managing graphical output in a limited environment.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Simulation and Timing:</strong>
                    Implementing the game's progression required managing timing and simulation steps. I integrated timing mechanisms to control the update rate of the grid, gaining experience in creating smooth simulations and managing real-time processes.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Debugging and Optimization:</strong>
                    The project involved extensive debugging to ensure correct implementation of the game's rules and to handle any issues related to the grid's updates. This process improved my problem-solving skills and ability to optimize code for better performance.
