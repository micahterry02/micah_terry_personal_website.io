            <h1>Dynamic Memory Allocator</h1>
            <p1>
                In this project I engineered a dynamic allocator fully able to replace C's built in allocator(malloc) 
                for memory in a Unix process. This project gave me intimate knowledge on low level programming and
                 systems building. This project was done for a class through my university and I therefore cannot publicly
                  display the github link, if you are interested in seeing the actual code for the project reach out to me 
                  through either my personal or school email and I would be happy to send the details privately!
