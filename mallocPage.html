            <h1 id="mallocTitle">Dynamic Memory Allocator</h1>
            <h1> malloc, realloc, and free in C</h1>
            <p>
                In this project, I rewrote the core memory management functions in C: <code>malloc</code>, <code>realloc</code>, and <code>free</code>. The objective was to create a custom memory allocator that efficiently handles memory allocation and deallocation for all singly-threaded programs. This involved developing a memory management system capable of allocating, resizing, and freeing memory blocks effectively.
            </p>
            <h2>Key Skills and Concepts Learned:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong>
                    Gained a deep understanding of memory management techniques, including allocation strategies, memory fragmentation, and garbage collection. This experience provided insights into how memory can be efficiently managed and reclaimed.
                </li>
                <li><strong>C Programming:</strong>
                    Enhanced my proficiency in C programming, particularly in low-level programming and managing memory directly. This project required careful handling of pointers and memory addresses to ensure correct functionality.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data Structures:</strong>
                    Applied various data structures such as linked lists and block headers to manage free and allocated memory blocks. This involved designing and implementing efficient algorithms for memory allocation and deallocation.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Debugging:</strong>
                    Developed advanced debugging skills to identify and resolve issues related to memory leaks, segmentation faults, and performance bottlenecks. This included using tools and techniques for thorough testing and validation.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong>
                    Learned techniques for optimizing the performance of the memory allocator, including minimizing overhead and improving allocation speed. This experience taught me how to balance efficiency with functionality.
                </li>

            <p>
                Overall, rewriting malloc, realloc, and free provided a profound understanding of memory management and enhanced my ability to write efficient, low-level code. The project reinforced my skills in C programming and memory optimization, laying a strong foundation for future system-level development.
